**HPROSE** is short for *High Performance Remote Object Service Engine*.

It is a modern, lightweight, cross-language, cross-platform, object-oriented, high performance, remote dynamic communication middleware. It is not only easy to use, but powerful. You just need a little time to learn, then you can use it to easily construct cross language cross platform distributed application system.

It contains a semi-text serialization format, an RPC protocol and its implementation. The meaning of semi-text is all the data are represented as text, except the original binary data. The serialization format is very compact. It takes up very little space, and can be parsed very quickly in programming language. You can use this serialization format without hprose RPC protocol in other communications protocols, data storage, and more. If you want to know more, please read [Hprose Specification](spec.mediawiki).
